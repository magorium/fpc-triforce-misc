Miscellaneous scripts and tools for FPC to aid our triforce (Amiga, AROS and MorphOS).


## tools/CHOICE.EXE

Well known choice command for windows.

Unfortunately not available (by default) for every windows version out there. Provided here for convenience only.

Place the command inside a directory that is part of your path environment variable (or alternatively add this directory to your path)


## tools/PString 

Tools that allows to extract words from given string and allows for additional parameters. Allows for input string to be read. It is a stripped down version of another (experimental) tool i was once working on (don't ask).

Place the command inside a directory that is part of your path environment variable (or alternatively add this directory to your path)


## scripts/update-fpc-trunk.bat

To do.
